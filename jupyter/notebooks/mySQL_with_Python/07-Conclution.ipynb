    "many developers prefer using an object-oriented paradigm rather than SQL queries to manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a technique that allows you to query and manipulate data from a database directly using an object-oriented language. An ORM library encapsulates the code needed to manipulate data, which eliminates the need to use even a tiny bit of SQL. Here are the most popular Python ORMs for SQL-based databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQLAlchemy is an ORM that facilitates communication between Python and other SQL databases. You can create different engines for different databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and so on. SQLAlchemy is commonly used alongside the pandas library to provide complete data-handling functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- peewee is a lightweight and fast ORM that’s quick to set up. This is quite useful when your interaction with the database is limited to extracting a few records. For example, if you need to copy selected records from a MySQL database into a CSV file, then peewee might be your best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Django ORM is one of the most powerful features of Django and is supplied alongside the Django web framework. It can interact with a variety of databases such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. Many Django-based applications use the Django ORM for data modeling and basic queries but often switch to SQLAlchemy for more complex requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might find one of these approaches to be more suitable for your application. If you’re not sure which one to use, then it’s best to go with the officially recommended MySQL Connector/Python that you saw in action in this tutorial."
